The provided Arduino sketch aims to create a simple sequential LED animation. It achieves this by utilizing three digital output pins connected to LEDs. In the `setup()` function, these pins are configured as outputs. The `loop()` function, which runs continuously, turns on each LED in sequence, delays for a short period to display the illuminated LED, and then turns it off before moving to the next LED. This process repeats indefinitely, creating the illusion of a sequential LED lighting effect.
